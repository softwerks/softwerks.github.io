As required by law: We may also use or process Your data as required for Us to comply with legal obligations.

**WHY WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**

We may share Your information with third parties in certain situations.  In particular, We may share Your data with third-party processors as needed to serve Our legitimate business interests, which include administration of Our website, administration of Your account, entering into contracts with You, communicating with You, taking orders for goods or services, delivering Our goods and services, identifying trends, protecting the security of Our company and website, and marketing additional goods and services to You. The legal basis for Our disclosure of Your data is both Your Consent to this Privacy Policy and Our own right to protect and promote Our legitimate business interests.

The following are specific reasons why We may share Your information:

**Third Party Processing:** We may disclose Your information to third parties who assist Us with various tasks, including payment processing, hosting services, email delivery, communications, and customer service. We may not always disclose these third-party processors if not required by law. We do not authorize them to use or disclose Your personal information except in connection with providing Our company with their services.

**By Law:** We may share Your data as required by law or to respond to legal process, including a subpoena, or as necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others. This includes sharing information with other parties to prevent or address fraud and to avoid credit risks.

**To Protect Our Company:** We may use Your information to protect Our company, including to investigate and remedy any violations of Our rights or policies. We may also disclose Your information as reasonably necessary to acquire and maintain insurance coverage, manage risks, obtain financial or legal advice, or to exercise or defend against legal claims.

**Business Transfers:** In the unlikely event Our company engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceedings, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding, We may transfer or share Your data as part of that proceeding. In such transitions, customer information is one of the business assets that is acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such business transfers may occur and that Your personal information can continue to be stored, used, or processed as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.

**External Links:** Our website may include hyperlinks to other websites not controlled by Us. We suggest You exercise caution when clicking on a hyperlink. Although We use reasonable care in including a hyperlink on Our own web page, We do not regularly monitor the websites of these third parties and are not responsible for any damage or consequences You suffer by using these hyperlinks. We are not bound by the Privacy Policies of any third-party website that You access by a hyperlink, nor are they bound by ours. We encourage You to read the Policies of those third-party websites before interacting with them or making purchases. They may collect different information and by different methods than We do.

**Other Purposes:** We may disclose Your personal data as necessary to comply with any legal obligation or to protect Your interests, or the vital interests of others or Our company.

**TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

**Log Files:** Like many other websites, We make use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the site – usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

**Cookies:** We also use cookies — small text files sent to Us by Your computer — to store certain information. We may use cookies to authenticate Your identity, to determine if You are logged onto Our website, for personalization, for security, or for analysis of the performance of Our website and services.

We may use any or all of the following types of cookies:

**Essential Cookies:** These cookies help Us run Our website and improve Your experience with Our website. These cookies may allow content to load more quickly or allow You to access “members only” or repeat-users sections of Our website.

**Functionality Cookies:** These cookies allow Us to remember Your preferences from earlier visits to Our website, including login information, so that You do not have to input the same information multiple times.

**Email Confirmations:** We may receive email confirmations when You open an email from Us. This allows Us to determine if users are responding favorably to Our email communications and to improve those communications.

**Other Technologies:** Other data technologies may be used that collect comparable information for security, fraud detection, and similar purposes, to give Us information about Your use of Our website, and to improve Our website and service offerings to You.

**PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION**

For the most part, We do not process Your information in-house, but give it to third-party processors for processing. For example, when Stripe takes Your payment information, they are a third-party processor. They process Your payment and remit the funds to Us. So in many instances, it will be necessary for Us to transmit Your information to a third-party processor, as We do not have the capability to perform these functions. More detail on third-party processing is detailed below.

However, We may, from time to time, process Your data internally. The legal basis for this processing is both Your consent to the processing, Our need to conduct Our legitimate business interests, and to comply with legal obligations. Our purposes in processing this information, if We do, is to administer, maintain, and improve Our website and offerings, to enter into contracts with You, to fulfill the terms of those contracts, to keep records of Our transactions and interactions, to be able to provide You with goods and services, to comply with Our legal obligations, to obtain professional advice, and to protect the rights and interests of Our company, Our customers (including You), and any third parties. We may process the following data:

1. Data associated with Your account, such as Your name, address, email address, and payment information.
2. Data about Your usage of Our website, such as Your IP address, geographical information, and how long You accessed Our website and what You viewed.
3. Data that You provide Us in the course of using Our services.
4. Data that You post on Our website.
5. Data that You submit to Us when You make an inquiry regarding Our website or offerings.
6. Data related to Your transactions with Us, including Your purchase of Our goods or services. This information may include contact details and payment information.
7. Data that You provide to Us when You subscribe to Our emails or newsletters, including Your email address and contact information.
8. Data that You submit to Us via correspondence, such as when You email Us with questions.
9. Any other data identified in this policy, for the purpose of complying with Our legal obligations, or to protect the vital interests of You or any other natural person.

Therefore, if You reside outside The United States of America, some of Your data will be transferred internationally to and stored on those servers. In addition, We may use third-party processors (including payment processors) and subcontractors located in The United States of America. We use all reasonable methods to protect the safety of Your data during transfer, including hosting Our website on reputable servers and engaging reputable third-party processors. By using this site and providing Us with information, You consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of Your information in The United States of America. Note that the privacy laws in The United States of America may not be as strict as those in other countries. Please be aware that:

The E.U. has determined that companies participating in the U.S. Privacy Shield have adequate safeguards in place to protect customer data.

**DATA RETENTION**

We retain personal data as long as it is needed to conduct Our legitimate business purposes or to comply with Our legal obligations, or until You ask Us to delete Your data. For example, We will retain certain personal information indefinitely for the purposes of maintaining Your account, unless and until You delete Your account. Data that We gather for a specific and particular purpose, such as assisting law enforcement or analyzing trends, will be kept for no longer than is necessary for that particular purpose. Data that is no longer needed by Us for any of the purposes listed above will be permanently deleted.

We will honor Your request to delete Your data, as described more fully below, unless We are required by law to retain access to the data.

If You wish to have any third parties, including those to whom We’ve transmitted Your data, delete that data, You will need to contact those third parties directly. You may request from Us a list of all third parties to whom We have transmitted Your data.

We may retain usage data (that is, data that is gathered by Our company or third-party analytics companies for the purpose of analyzing the use of Our website) as needed for internal analysis purposes. This type of data is usually retained for a shorter period of time than personal data, unless the data is necessary to improve the security or functionality of Our website or offerings, or We are legally obligated to retain the data for a longer period of time.

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We take all reasonable steps to protect Your personal data and keep Your information secure. We use recognized online secure payment systems and implement generally accepted standards of security to protect against personal data loss or misuse. However, no security measure is foolproof, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse. We cannot guarantee complete security of any information You transmit to Us.

By consent to this Privacy Policy, You acknowledge that Your personal data may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of Your data by other parties.

We will notify You promptly of any known breach of Our security systems or Your data which might expose You to serious risk.
